## Introduction
<img alt="spring boot logo" align="left" src="https://coursereport-s3-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/school/logo/589/original/codecool-logo-symbol.png" width="20">

This is a **Codecool** team project created during the last module of the school. Its aim was to deepen our React knowledge while creating a frontend app on top of an existing open API. The contributors are [Máté Groholy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgroholy/) and [Kriszti Tóth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kriszti-toth/).

The application retrieves data from a NASA API, and makes it possible to easily browse photos taken by Mars rovers on any device due to its responsiveness.

The app has been deployed with the help of Netlify: [mars-rover-gallery.netlify.app](https://mars-rover-gallery.netlify.app/)
